# Befunge

A fully functional [Befunge-93](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge) interpreter written in Rust.

## Features

- Fully compatible
- Step by step interpretation
- Hooks for stack modification and the `p` operation
- Custom input/output methods

## Minor differences

- The grid is not limited to 80x25 spaces - the spaces here are unlimited BUT you'll have to add all the whitespaces yourself once you go past the default playfield.
